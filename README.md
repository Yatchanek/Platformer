I decided to open source my 2D platformer project, as I don't see the potential in it and myself to make it into a fun game. Feel free to experiment with it, build upon it, learn from it, etc.

Currently there's a tutorial level and one test level. No main menu, no sounds, no music.

Disclaimer: This is a work in progress, so some stuff may (surely is) buggy, unfinished, unoptimized, prior to refactor. The file structure is a mess, it should be more organized, but I always tend to do it at the end. I tried to delete all the unnecessary files.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions, but with every passing day I will remember less and less about this project.

Created with Godot 4.1.2. Not tested with other versions.
